#+TITLE: XSLT Explorer

XSLT Explorer is an XSLT stylesheet that performs a small amount of
static analysis on an XSLT stylesheet and publishes the results in
HTML. The idea is that it gives you an overview of the structure of
your stylesheet.

Explorer identifies templates, functions, and variables within each
module. It attempts to show you any that are unused, shadowing other
globals, or are used only once in another module.
